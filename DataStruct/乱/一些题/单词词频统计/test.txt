Welcome to Nanjing University! As a librarian of it, I'd like to introduce something necessary about our library for all newly-enrolled overseas students.
    To begin with, the library opens at 7 o'clock and closes at 10 o'clock every day except festival and holiday. And those who want to study at the library have to get a card to qualify.  If you don't have it, you have better sign up at your class monitor before Sep 10, 2019. What'more, keeping quiet is extremely vital at the library to have a good learning atmosphere.
    In the end, we are so glad to hear that you have taken the opportunity to study at our university. I am sure you will have a wonderful time here.
